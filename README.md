# Happiness Mini Project

## Project Overview
This mini data science project analyzes the World Happiness Report 2021 dataset.  


The project loads the happiness dataset, calculates key statistics such as the average happiness score, and visualizes the results using a bar chart that shows the happiness score by country.

All steps are automated in a single script, making the analysis easy to reproduce.
